% 
% Produces a grid of wavenumbers suitable for the spectral analysis
% of spatial data as part of the Olhede & Simons suite
%
% INPUT:
%
% params   A structure with AT LEAST these constants
%          dydx  sampling interval in the y and x directions [m m]
%          NyNx  number of samples in the y and x directions
%          blurs 0 Don't blur likelihood using the Fejer window
%                N Blur likelihood using the Fejer window [default: N=2]
% doit     1 Actually USE the params.blurs value to interpolate the k-grid 
%          (Anything goes for this parameter, only the presence counts)
% 
% OUTPUT (either THREE, or TWO, depending on the input, IN ADDITION to kx,ky):
%
% kor       The wavenumber matrix (the norm of the wave vectors)
% dci       The (m,n) indices to the DC component [at floor(dim/2)+1]
% dcn       The (m,n) indices to the components at exactly the Nyquist
%           (if any: not for odd-length dimensions; one-sided for even)
% 
% kblur     The interpolated wavenumber axis all ready to be blurred
% kzero     The running index of the zero-wavenumber in the unblurred matrix
% dcn       The (m,n) indices to the components at the Nyquist in kblur
%           (if any: not for odd-length dimensions; one-sided for even)
%
% kx,ky     The components of the wave vector
%

  % We usually run KNUM2 once focused on the output grid
  [k,kx,ky,dci,dcn]=knum2(NyNx,[(NyNx(1)-1)*dydx(1) (NyNx(2)-1)*dydx(2)]);

  % Shouldn't we indeed be able to use ANY refinement grid?
  % Should we protect against parity CHANGE? The original
  % motivation was to avoid HERMCHECK errors, which, however, could
  % be made to go away with higher-order interpolation, which,
  % however, could lead to negatives in the convolved kernels. 
  % Seems like we should, but doing it makes the errors behaved
  % inconsistently for the even and odd cases, as gleaned from BLUROSY_CHECK.
  % I can only infer the preference to emerge from CONV2 or
  % INTERP2, possibly symmetry is to  be preferred. Maybe it's
  % because linear can't deal with the period symmetry of the grid.
  % So from now we avoid any additions or substitutions.
  % pp=mod(NyNx,2)~=mod(bNyNx,2);

  % And then we run KNUM2 again to do the blurring later
  [k,kx,ky,~,dcn]=knum2(bNyNx,[(bNyNx(1)-1)*dydx(1) (bNyNx(2)-1)*dydx(2)]);
  % But then we still will want the RUNNING index of the zero in the
  % UNBLURRED matrix without running this same function again, so
  % produce that under the fake name that gets used on the inside only
