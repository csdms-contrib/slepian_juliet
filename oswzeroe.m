% Print the scaling of the theoretical values
fprintf(fid,'%s\n','The scaling factors');
fprintf(fid,fmti{4},scl);

% Now print the unscaled theoretical covariance to file also
fprintf(fid,'%s\n','The covariance from the Fisher matrix at the truth');
fprintf(fid,fmti{1},trilos(covF0));

% Print the scaled Fisher matrix, the expected value of the Hessian
fprintf(fid,'%s\n','The scaled Fisher matrix at the truth');
fprintf(fid,fmti{2},trilos(F0));

% Print the observed scaled average of the Hessians (over last set of runs)
fprintf(fid,'%s\n',...
        sprintf('The scaled numerical Hessian matrix averaged over whichever %i runs last output',...
                good));
fprintf(fid,fmti{2},trilos(avhsz));

% Print the COVTHOSL using an exact method
