% [L,g,H,momx,vr,Lk]=LOGLIOSL(k,th,scl,params,Hk,xver)
%
% Calculates the full negative logarithmic likelihood and its derivatives as
% averaged over wavenumber space. This is the function that we MINIMIZE! No
% consideration is given to the zero wavenumbers or to those beyond params.kiso
%
% INPUT:
%
% k        The wavenumbers at which these are being evaluated [1/m]
% th       The three-parameter vector argument [scaled]
%          th(1)=s2   The first Matern parameter [variance in unit^2]
%          th(2)=nu   The second Matern parameter [differentiability]
%          th(3)=rho  The third Matern parameter [range in m]
% scl      The scaling factors applied, so that [scl.*thhat] is in units 
% params   A structure with AT LEAST these constants that are known:
%          dydx  sampling interval in the y and x directions [m m]
%          NyNx  number of samples in the y and x directions
%          blurs 0 Don't blur likelihood using the Fejer window
%                N Blur likelihood using the Fejer window [default: N=2]
%                -1 Blur likelihood using the exact BLUROSY procedure
%                Inf in which case it gets a hard reset to -1
%          kiso   wavenumber beyond which we are not considering the likelihood
%          (ksel   logical structure with wavenumbers being taken into account)
%          taper  0 there is no taper near of far
%                 1 it's a unit taper, implicitly
%                 OR an appropriately sized taper with proper values 
%                 (1 is yes and 0 is no and everything in between)
% Hk       A [prod(params.NyNx)*1]-column of complex Fourier-domain observations
% xver     Excessive verification [0 or 1, which also computes L(k)]
%
% OUTPUT:
%
% L        The logarithmic loglihood averaged over all nonzero wavenumbers
% g        The score averaged over all nonzero wavenumbers
% H        The Hessian averaged over all nonzero wavenumbers
% momx     Moments of the quadratic piece Xk over relevant wavenumbers;
%          the last one we use for a test on this being chi-squared
% vr       Variance of momx(3) under the null hypothesis
% Lk       The logarithmic loglihood prior to averaging over the wavenumbers

% p.quart=0; p.blurs=0; p.kiso=NaN; clc; [~,th0,p,k,Hk]=simulosl([],p,1);
% F=fishiosl(k,th0); g=gammiosl(k,th0,p,Hk); H=hessiosl(k,th0,p,Hk);
% round(abs((F+H)./F)*100) % should be small percentages
% [L,Lg,LH]=logliosl(k,th0,1,p,Hk);
% difer(Lg-g); difer(LH-H); % should be passing the test
